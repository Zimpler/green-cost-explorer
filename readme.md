# Green Cost Explorer - climate related spend analysis for AWS

If you work in technology, it's reasonable to think that you have some respect for science.

And if you have some respect for science, then you'll understand why spending a significant of your monthly AWS bills on fossil fuel powered infrastructure isn't a thing we can afford to do anymore.

Because Amazon provide a helpful breakdown of which [regions you use run on what they refer to as sustainable power, and which ones do not][1], and [because they provide a cost-explorer tool][2], you combine this information to get an idea of where you might be spending money on fossil fuels without realising.

You can also just look at this nice cartoon. The ones which are notionally sustainable, have the green leaf next to them:

### What this does

TODO

- Sort your monthly spend into green vs grey spend
- Create a basic table showing this
- Show this as a chart
- Project forward, using AWS's cost projection features

### Usage

This is a wrapper around the AWS NodeJS SDK, and because of this, you need to set following environment variables to get results back:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='YOUR_KEY_ID'
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
```

Once you have this, call `greencost` to get an idea of your spend over the last year.

It looks for the AWS credentials in your environment, but if you're not comfortable with this, the [AWS SDK lets you pass in credentials][creds] in number of ways.

```
npx greencost
```

If all goes well (ahem, and [once the table output has actually been implementedâ€¦][issue-1]), you'll get something like this:

```
|          | Grey   | Green  |
-----------|--------|--------|
|Aug  2018 |  40%   |  60%   |
|Sept 2018 |  40%   |  60%   |
|Oct  2018 |  40%   |  60%   |
|Nov  2018 |  40%   |  60%   |
|Dec  2018 |  40%   |  60%   |

```

### Licensing

Feel free to use this commercially - part of your job as a professional in tech is to avoid unnecessary harm, and burning fossil fuels, objectively causes harm, and is totally avoidable, by either switching regions, or using a different provider.

It's all about tracking your own spend, so it's actually pretty hard to make this something you couldn't use to commercial use

So, Apache 2.0, yo.
